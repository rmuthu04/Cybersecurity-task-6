TASK 6 – PASSWORD STRENGTH EVALUATION REPORT

Submitted by: Muthukumaran R

-------------------------------------------------------------

1) AIM / OBJECTIVE  
To understand what makes a password strong by creating multiple passwords with varying complexity and evaluating their strength using an online password strength checker.

2) TOOL USED  
Website: https://passwordmeter.com

3) METHODOLOGY / PROCEDURE  
• Created five passwords with different complexity levels (weak → strong)  
• Checked each password in the passwordmeter.com tool  
• Noted strength rating, estimated cracking time, and feedback  
• Compared results and extracted best practices

4) OBSERVATION AND RESULTS  

Password 1: muthu123  
• Strength: Weak (< 1 second to crack)  
• Reason: Very short, predictable, common pattern  

Password 2: Muthu@2003  
• Strength: Medium  
• Reason: Mixed characters but uses name and year (predictable)  

Password 3: Muthu@2003!  
• Strength: Strong  
• Reason: Better complexity with extra special character but still pattern-based  

Password 4: MuthuKumaran@2003#  
• Strength: Strong / Very Strong  
• Reason: Long length improves security but contains personal info  

Password 5: My$ecureP@ssw0rd!2025  
• Strength: Very Strong  
• Reason: Long, random, mixed charset, not based on personal identity  

5) ANALYSIS / DISCUSSION  
From the experiment, it is clear that:  
• Length is a major factor in resisting brute-force attacks  
• Removing personal info prevents targeted and dictionary attacks  
• Special characters + numbers + upper/lowercase increases entropy  
• Passphrases or random strings are more secure than names + years

6) COMMON PASSWORD ATTACKS  
• Brute Force Attack – Tries all combinations until correct  
• Dictionary Attack – Uses known password wordlists  
• Credential Stuffing – Uses leaked passwords from breaches  
• Phishing Attack – Tricks user to reveal password

7) BEST PRACTICES  
• Use 12–16+ characters minimum  
• Avoid names, years, dictionary words  
• Use a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols  
• Do not reuse passwords for different accounts  
• Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)  
• Use password managers for strong unique passwords

8) CONCLUSION  
Password strength depends on complexity, unpredictability, and length.  
Strong, unique passwords combined with MFA provide effective protection  
against brute-force, dictionary, and credential-based attacks.
